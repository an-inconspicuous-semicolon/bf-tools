# The brainf*ck benchmark

This program is a challenge to make the brainf*ck mandelbrot program run as fast as physically possible by any means
necessary (almost).

The only rules are as follows:

- You must not modify the brainf*ck code itself.
- You cannot use speculative execution (the program must start with zeroed memory).

Anything else is fair game, including changing the code, creating compiled executables and running them, and fiddling
about with the process priorities etc.

# Submitting your score

To submit your score, copy your code into files with your name. Then copy the output of the program into the benchmarks
folder with the name of the interpreter used and the build version.
Finally make a pull request with your system info and any notes, and I'll add the results to a table below.

Have fun and good luck!
